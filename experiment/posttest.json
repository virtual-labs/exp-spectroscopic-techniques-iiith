      "question": "1. Which of the following wavelength ranges is associated with UV spectroscopy?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "0.8 - 500 Âµm",
        "b": "400 - 100 nm",
        "c": "380 - 750 nm",
        "d": "0.01 - 10 nm"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "this is the IR region",
        "b": "this is the near IR region and not used in UV spectroscopy",
        "c": "This is the UV-Visible range. UV Spectroscopy uses this range of radiations.",
        "d": "this is the X-ray range of radiation"

      "question": "2. In infrared spectroscopy which frequency range is known as the fingerprint region?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "400 - 1400cm<sup>-1</sup>",
        "b": "1400 - 1700cm<sup>-1</sup>",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "this is the fingerprint region of IR spectroscopy where a large number of peaks are obtained and it is difficult to identify them",
        "b": "this is the IR range for C=C, C=O and C=N.",
        "c": "this is the IR range for C triple bonded to C and N.",
        "d": "this is the IR range for single bonds involving H."
