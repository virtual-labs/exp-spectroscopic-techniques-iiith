      "question": "1. Which of the following statements regarding IR spectroscopy is correct?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "IR radiation is higher in energy than UV radiation",
        "b": "IR spectra records the scattering of the radiation",
        "c": "IR spectra gives information about the ƛ<sub>max</sub> of the molecule",
        "d": "IR radiation is higher in wavelength than UV radiation"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "IR radiation has lower frequency than UV due to which IR has lower energy than UV.",
        "b": "Scattering is not recorded by IR but X-ray scattering.",
        "c": "ƛ<sub>max</sub> is a property of UV spectra.",
        "d": "IR radiations are higher in wavelength than UV."

      "question": "2. What is the condition for a molecule to be Microwave active?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Change in dipole movement",
        "b": "Change in polarisability",
        "c": "Permanent dipole movement",
        "d": "Isotopic labelling"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "microwave spectroscopy arises due to rotation of the molecule, rotation alone cannot produce any change in the dipole moment.",
        "b": "change of  polarisability does not affect the microwave interaction of the molecule.",
        "c": "all molecules which have permanent dipole moment are microwave active.",
        "d": "isotopic labelling does not qualify for a molecule to be Microwave active as labelling is done to identify a specific atom or reaction."

      "question": "3. Identify the correct statement.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "NMR signals towards the left of the spectrum correspond to low chemical shift values.",
        "b": "NMR signals towards the right of the spectrum correspond to high chemical shift values",
        "c": "Chemical shift values are larger when shielding effects are greater",
        "d": "Chemical shift values are larger when deshielding effects are greater"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "NMR signals towards the left of the spectrum correspond to high chemical shift values.",
        "b": "NMR signals towards the right of the spectrum correspond to low chemical shift values",
        "c": "Chemical shift values are smaller when shielding effects are greater i.e. the values are closer to 0.",
        "d": "Chemical shift values are larger when deshielding effects are greater i.e. the values are farther away from 0."

      "question": "4. The absorption intensity on an absorption spectrum tells us:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "energy associated with a particular excitation.",
        "b": "the ease of transition.",
        "c": "the concentration of the absorbing part of the molecule.",
        "d": "both the ease of transition and the concentration of the absorbing part of the molecule."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "energy of transition is given by the position of the signal and not its intensity.",
        "b": "ease of transition does affect the intensity but only to some extent.",
        "c": "absorption intensity depends on the concentration of the absorbing part of the molecule.",
        "d": "absorption intensity depends more on the concentration."
