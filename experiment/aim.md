Principle behind all spectroscopic techniques is that under certain conditions, materials absorb or emit energy . Different spectroscopic techniques work over different ranges of frequency depending on the processes and magnitudes of the energy changes.

Electromagentic radiation: microwave, Infra Red, Visible and Ultaviolet, X-ray and gamma rays spectroscopy.
