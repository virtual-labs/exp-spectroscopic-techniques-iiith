The principle behind all spectroscopic techniques is that under certain conditions, materials absorb or emit energy. Different spectroscopic techniques work over different ranges of frequency depending on the processes and magnitudes of the energy changes.

Electromagnetic radiation: Microwave, Infra-Red, Visible and Ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma rays spectroscopy.
Acoustic spectroscopy
Other mechanical methods.

The aim is the identification of unknown compounds through a combination of spectroscopic methods. Used here are Infrared spectroscopy, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, and Mass spectroscopy.
