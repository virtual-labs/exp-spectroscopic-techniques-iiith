- Select one of the two compounds before proceeding to the experiments

- Choose one of the three experiments to proceed to the lab.

- Each lab has its own manual

**Manual for IR experiments:**

1. Click on the sample bottle (the first bottle) to transfer a small quantity of the sample to the mortar.

2. Click on the mortar to grind the sample to fine paste.

3. Click on the bottle containing Nujol to transfer few drops to the mortar.

4. Click on the mortar to make a fine paste of sample

5. Transfer the sample prepared onto one of the IR discs
6. Place carefully the other disc and press to form a thin film.
7. Move the IR plates to the plate holder
8. Place the other part of the holder to sandwich the IR discs.

9. Click on the holder to place the the sample in the spectrometer.

10. Click start to run the spectrometer.


**Manual for NMR experiments:*

1. Click on fill the sample prepared into the NMR tubes

2. Click on load the sample into the NMR spectrometer

3. Click ons tart the measurement

4. Click on Plot to plot the NMR spectrum

5. Click on the evaluation button to analyse the spectrum.


**Manual for Mass experiments:**

1. Select a sample

2. Click on the solvent bottle to draw 1 ml of the solvent (methanol) and inject it into the sample inlet to clean any impurity in the sample pathway.

3. Click on the sample bottle to transfer small amount (around 1mg) of the substance into the empty sample bottle.

4. Click on the solvent bottle to transfer 5 ml of the solvent (methanol) to the substance taken.

5. Click on the sample solution to make a clear solution.

6. Click on the sample solution to draw 1 ml of the sample prepared to load on to the mass spectrometer.

7. Click on 'start' button to start the spectrometer

8. Click on the evaluation button for spectral analysis.
