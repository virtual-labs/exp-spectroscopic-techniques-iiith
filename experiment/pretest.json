      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Radio waves are used to flip the spin of protons in NMR.",
        "b": "Ultraviolet waves are used in UV-Visible spectroscopy",
        "c": "X-ray are used in X-ray diffraction spectroscopy.",
        "d": "Microwaves are used in rotational spectroscopy."

      "question": "2. Mass spectrometry differs from spectroscopy because:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "it is a destructive technique.",
        "b": "it involves the absorption of radio waves.",
        "c": "it involves the absorption of infrared waves.",
        "d": "it involves the absorption of ultraviolet waves"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "it is a destructive technique as it destroys the sample and breaks it into smaller fragments.",
        "b": "it does not absorb radio waves.",
        "c": "it does not absorb infrared waves.",
        "d": "it does not absorb UV rays too."
